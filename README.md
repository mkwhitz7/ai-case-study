Salman “Sal” Amin Khan is the founder of Khan Academy, a free online non-profit educational platform.

Sal Khan initially began this journey with a series of videos on YouTube to help his cousins with their studies. This eventually launched into a comprehensive educational resource offering free courses with a wide range of subjects.

These foundations have been credited with support of education initiatives worldwide, and they believe Khan academy can help expand access to quality education globally.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Khan Academy’s mission is to provide a free world class education to any and every one, worldwide. The organization recognizes that high quality education is not accessible to everyone due to socioeconomic, geographic, and systemic barriers. To solve this problem, Khan Academy offers free educational resources to anyone with internet access globally. As a former educator of 5 years, I’ve witnessed discrepancies from country to country, state to state, and even county to county. Educational inequities are crippling this world from its truest potential and Khan Academy aims to level the playing field, ensuring underprivileged students have the same opportunities to learn just as their more advantaged peers.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Khan Academy intended customers are students, educators, parents, educational institutions, and standardized test takers. Students are not limited to K-12, but also includes college students, and lifelong learners who wish to develop skills and revisit previous topics of interest. Classroom teachers use Khan Academy for additional resources to enhance their lesson plans. This foundation also serves as a staple for homeschooling educators/parents that requires structured and comprehensive learning material. It is a beneficial source for schools and school districts seeking individual student’s needs. Colleges and universities also use this source for remedial education. Due to this versatility, Khan Academy’s market size is truly limitless as it aspires to reach billions of internet users globally.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Khan Academy differs from its competitors in several ways, but mainly because it's free! This company offers free access to high quality education, and has made it the selling point in their business model. All resources are available to anyone with internet access, regardless of geographic or economic barriers. In comparison, many competitors offer free content but usually have premium content behind a paywall. Another advantage this company has is its broad spectrum of comprehensive and diverse content. Some competitors address specific needs, offer personalized learning paths, but are yet to use data analytics to tailor the learning experience. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sluething&mdash;you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Khan Academy currently leverages a variety of technologies to deliver and enhance its educational experience. The most relevant being AI and machine learning. Generally, these technologies are implemented to help develop tutoring systems that can personalize student needs and offer tailored assistance. More specifically, stacks such as SQL, Apache Spark, and Jupyter Notebooks are the frameworks to build and maintain its platform. Other stacks mentioned are React, Google App Engine, Javascript, GitLab/Hub, Python, and Google Analytics.

Core metrics in education are mostly centered around learning outcomes. According to Khan Academy, MAP Growth is the nationally normed standardized assessment. This program is designed to help learners achieve proficient/mastery in their desired subject. The Every School Succeeds Act(ESSA) was created in 2015 as a replacement for No Child Left Behind.The ESSA tiers of evidence has provided schools with the best practices to assure the best results.

## Recommendation

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Khan Academy has done a plethora of things correctly, and its challenging to critique. My question is why haven’t I heard about it more. Educators are struggling for resources that are continuously limited, or discontinued by the district. My number one recommendation would be marketing and outreach. There should be targeted campaigns specifically for all of those communities that need it the most. I’d start with the states that ranked the lowest in education across America. A free product is the best selling point! 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

A marketing team would help this company achieve its goal of providing education globally.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

I would also propose improving user interface experience. I would strive to simplify navigation by suggesting ways to streamline the website or app navigation. The goal is to make the site easier for users and access courses. I’d also suggest new content areas or subjects that are currently underserved. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These technologies will assure a user friendly site, and will encourage new users to interact more frequently.
